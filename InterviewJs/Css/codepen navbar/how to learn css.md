## Tips
1. **Don't guess.** It's really hard to learn CSS by trial and error (hmm.. what if I change this property here....). understand the logic, rules and basic CSS concepts, and yourlife will be mush easier
1. **Practice** by building mocks of your favorite widgets online. Get as close as you can to the original
1. Use **Inspect element** a lot to learn from quality web sites.
1. Don't just copy and paste. **Understand why it works** like it does.
1. **Build one thing at a time**. Make sure it's responsive and looks good and then move on.

## Some tools you might need:
1. a good color picker (I use **Instant Eyedropper**)
1. a good ruler. like [this](http://www.arulerforwindows.com/index.html)
